# My Neighborhood Health

## Overview
The My Neighborhood Health application was created to raise awareness of toxic chemical facilities in the Illinois area. A user can peruse the Illinois map to identify toxic chemical facilities locations and can link out to learn more about each toxic chemical. The user can also join communities have conversations on environmental topics, or catch up on environmental news. 

## User Experience

* On the home page, the user can see a map of Illinois with orange markers representing facilities that work with toxic chemicals.
* User can hover over or click on the orange markers to get more information about the TRI Facility. 
  * Name of TRI Facility
  * Compliance History
* On the news page, the user can read latest environmental news.
* On the communities, the user can post comments on a topic of interest. 

## Application Development
This application was built using the following NPM Packages: body-parser, express, bcrypt, cheerio, and mongoose. The frontend uses the Google Maps API and some bootstrap for styling. The user registration and communities database for this application was built in Mongo. The data for the app was taken from the TOXNET Web Service API.
